Master the lead management and outreach system to build your business pipeline systematically.

## Lead Management System

### 1. Adding New Leads

**Quick Add Method** (30 seconds)
- Dashboard → Quick Actions → "+Lead"
- Fill required fields:
  - Name (required)
  - Business (optional but recommended)
  - Source (where you found them)

**Detailed Add Method** (2 minutes)

  - Business details and niche
  - Source and context
  - Priority level
  - Next action date
  - Initial notes

### 2. Lead Prioritization

**Priority Levels:**
- **5 (Hot)**: Ready to buy, high intent
- **4 (Warm)**: Engaged, good fit
- **3 (Qualified)**: Meets criteria, needs nurturing
- **2 (Cold)**: Potential but low engagement
- **1 (Long-term)**: Future opportunity

### 3. Lead Sources to Track
- Social media (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram)
- Referrals from existing clients
- Content responses (blog, video comments)
- Networking events
- Cold outreach responses
- Website inquiries

## Kanban Pipeline Management

### Column Workflow
```
New → Contacted → Booked → Won/Lost
```

**New**
- Fresh leads not yet contacted
- Sort by priority (5s at top)
- Aim to contact within 24 hours

**Contacted**
- Initial outreach sent
- Waiting for response
- Follow-up scheduled

**Booked**
- Meeting/call scheduled
- Proposal sent
- In active negotiation

**Won**
- Deal closed successfully
- Move to revenue tracking
- Update deal amount

**Lost**
- Opportunity closed (for now)
- Note reason in lead notes
- Set future follow-up date

### Daily Pipeline Actions (5 minutes)

1. **Review New leads** - Contact top priority leads
2. **Follow up Contacted** - Send 2nd/3rd touch messages
3. **Prepare for Booked** - Review notes before calls
4. **Update Won/Lost** - Move completed deals

## Social Reps Strategy

### What Counts as a Social Rep
- **Direct Messages**: LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter DMs
- **Email Outreach**: Personal, non-automated messages
- **Comments**: Thoughtful responses on posts
- **Phone/Video**: Any direct conversation
- **In-Person**: Networking, coffee meetings

### Quality Guidelines
- Personal and specific to the recipient
- Provides value or asks thoughtful questions
- Advances the relationship forward
- Shows genuine interest in their business

### Daily Rep Targets
- **10 total interactions** for full 20 points
- **Mix**: 40% existing leads, 60% new prospects
- **Channels**: Vary between LinkedIn, email, and others
- **Value-first**: Help before asking

## Outreach Logging

### Quick Logging (15 seconds)
```
Dashboard → Quick Rep → Count: 1 → Notes: "LinkedIn DM to Sarah about automation" → Add
```

### Detailed Logging
```
Leads page → Find lead → Log Outreach
- Channel: LinkedIn
- Notes: "Sent connection request with personal note about their recent automation post"
- Outcome: Sent
```

### Outcome Types
- **Sent**: Message delivered
- **Reply**: They responded
- **Booked**: Meeting scheduled
- **Declined**: Not interested
- **No Response**: After follow-up sequence

## Revenue Tracking Integration

### When Deals Close
1. **Move lead to Won** in Kanban
2. **Log the deal** in Revenue section:
   - Amount (total deal value)
   - COGS (your costs)
   - Source (which lead/channel)
   - Date closed
3. **Update lead notes** with deal details

### Deal Tracking Fields
- **Amount**: Total revenue
- **COGS**: Your delivery costs
- **Net Profit**: Calculated automatically
- **Source**: Lead source that generated deal
- **Notes**: Deal specifics, terms, etc.

## Weekly Optimization

### Monday Planning (10 minutes)
- Review pipeline health
- Set weekly outreach targets
- Plan content that attracts leads
- Schedule follow-ups

### Friday Review (10 minutes)
- Analyze conversion rates (Reports page)
- Update stalled leads
- Plan next week's focus areas
- Celebrate wins

## Advanced Strategies

### Lead Scoring
Automatically prioritize based on:
- Engagement level (replies, opens)
- Business fit (size, industry)
- Budget indicators
- Timeline urgency

### Outreach Sequences
Plan 5-7 touchpoint sequences:
1. Initial connection/introduction
2. Value-add follow-up (article, tool)
3. Social proof (case study)
4. Direct ask (meeting request)
5. Alternative offer (resource, consultation)
6. Timing check ("maybe later?")
7. Long-term nurture

### Analytics to Watch
- **Response rate**: % of outreach that gets replies
- **Meeting rate**: % that convert to calls
- **Close rate**: % of meetings that become deals
- **Time to close**: Days from first contact to deal

## Troubleshooting

**"Low response rates"**
- Personalize more (reference specific posts/content)
- Lead with value, not asks
- Improve your social proof/credibility
- Test different message templates

**"Leads going cold"**
- Shorter follow-up sequences
- More value-focused content
- Better lead qualification upfront
- Systematic follow-up schedule

**"Pipeline not moving"**
- Clear next actions for each lead
- Regular Kanban board updates
- Better qualification questions
- Consistent follow-up rhythm

Remember: The system works when you work the system. Consistency in outreach beats perfection in any single message!
